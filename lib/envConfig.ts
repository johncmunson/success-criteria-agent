import { loadEnvConfig } from "@next/env"

// Usage: import "./lib/envConfig.ts"
// Necessary when running scripts in this repo that need to read environment variables but aren't
// running as part of the NextJS runtime, which loads environment variables automatically. For example,
// running Drizzle migrations.
